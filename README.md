# CSE-Result-Bot

A simple bot to get your semester results directly in your telegram app. You can access the bot [here](https://t.me/cseresult_bot).     
Up till now this bot works for B.Tech(CSE) <i>2017 batch</i> students of affiliated colleges of IPU.  
Feel free to ask any doubt or questions.  
I converted the results pdf to text files for faster execution of the queries.  
<b>Note:</b> Currently the bot does support results of USIT stdents as they have a seperate result PDF.
